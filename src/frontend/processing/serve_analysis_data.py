This script takes the item_name from the user and 
multiplies that item's analysis_table data with today's summary data
to make an item_specific investment prediction. It also takes
14day_price.csv and 14day_vol.csv and plots them on the same graph,
allowing the user to visualize interactions between price and 
volume (even when daily volume is ~100 and price is ~1,000,000,000)
